# If any modules outside of the core perl distribution are required,
# these should be included as a PREREQ_PM entry in WriteMakefile below, 
# as indicated in the example. This example requires the modules 
# MOD1 and MOD2 to be installed, with minimal versions 1 and 5,
# respectively. If the version number is 0, any version is sufficient.
#
# As well, if you wish to force a minimal perl version to run the
# script, insert a line, for example,
#
#   require 5.004;
#
# below.

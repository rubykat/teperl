teperl 0.04
============

This is the README file for teperl, a perl script to
process embedded perl in a file.

The teperl script was written as a minimalist replacement for eperl
<http://www.ossp.org/pkg/tool/eperl/> which hadn't changed since 1998,
and as a consequence, failed to install on Mandrake 9.  This script
uses the excellent Text::Template module instead.

For more information on how to use the script, see the
pod documentation via the command
  perldoc teperl
or, after installation, view the man pages with
  man teperl

Problems, questions, etc. may be sent to <perlkat AT katspace.com>

INSTALLATION

To install the script and man pages in the standard areas, 
give the sequence of commands

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

If you want to install the script in your own private space, use

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/private/perllib \
       INSTALLMAN1DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man1 \
       INSTALLMAN3DIR=/my/private/perllib/man/man3      
  make
  make test
  make install

Any libraries installed in such non-standard places may then
need to have the appropriate path to them specified in the script.

Note that `make test` may not necessarily be enabled.

DEPENDENCIES

This script requires these other modules:

	Text::Template
	Getopt::Long
	Pod::Usage
